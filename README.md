# InstaDock

## Introduction

**InstaDock** is a front-end graphical user interface written in Python to perform molecular docking-based virtual high-throughput screening that can be done in just one go. It provides users a **single-click interactive platform** to perform **automated continuous docking** of large compound databases against predefined protein targets. It will also help the user to **visualize** and **analyze** the results to identify promising lead molecules. InstaDock provides a straightforward graphical user interface and a complete suite to perform molecular docking and high-throughput virtual screening on **Windows-based computers**.

InstaDock employs a few standard programs for docking, molecular conversion, and visualization purposes, as well as several Python scripts for processing and execution. It automatically detects the receptor and ligand molecules in the directory. After the process, it creates a **‘Result’** folder containing:

- All docked files
- Docking scores
- Top hits
- Their split conformers
- A brief write-up

Various standalone programs available in the **‘Tools’** menu of InstaDock give the user the freedom to perform **‘User-directed Docking’** and other tasks by executing individual programs as described in the original publication ([Click here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa279)).
